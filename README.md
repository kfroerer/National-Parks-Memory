Nothing's more frustrating than having a window reload slow down the game you're playing! The next thing
you know the timer's up and you've lost! 

No more! National Parks Memory utilizes the virtual DOM of React to eliminate the need to reload anything!

Test your visual memory with stunning images from popular national parks. Many may look similar, but don't get confused. They are each a different park! 

Click on any picture, but only once! Make a mistake and click twice on a picture and the game is over. 

Play and try to get the highest score possible of 12! 

Feel inspired?? Be sure to visit these gorgeous parks! 

Featured parks include: 
Arches, Big Bend, Carlsbad Caverns, Glacier, Grand Canyon, Great Smoky Mountains, Mesa Verde, Olympic, Sequoia, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Zion's.
